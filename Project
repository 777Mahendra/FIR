FIR filter Design

In MATLAB

1. Enter filterDesigner in MATLAB command window
2. It opens a filter designer window.
3. Select following options:  
    a. bandpass
    b. FilterOrder = Minimum
    c. Density factor = 20
    d. Frequency spec :  Sampling freq = 48000, fstop1 = 500, fpass1 = 1500, fpass2 = 8000 ; fstop2 = 9000
   
 4. Press design filter.
 5. You can see filter response plot with band-pass characteristics
 6. Go to File->Export  and export MATLAB file. This will store all filter coefficients.
 
 7. Write a MATLAB code to
     a. read the above values into a variable by using load command. Consider 20 filter coefficients
     b. convert them into fixed point Q(2,14). Store these values into a file.
     c. Generate 4 sinewaves of 100Hz, 2000Hz, 6000Hz, 11000Hz and sample at 48000Hz. consider 5 cycles
     d. Convert these values into Q(2,14)format and store them into file(s).
 8. Write MATLAB code to get the output for these 4 signals using the designed filter (consider 20 filter coefficients). Plot outputs for 4 signals
 
 In Verilog
 
 1. read filter coefficients file and 4 signal files
 2. write modules to find  output values for each of the signal, when the given filter is applied
 3. Store Output results into different files.
 4. Read the output values in MATLAB and make plots and verify that output plots match with those from MATLAB.
